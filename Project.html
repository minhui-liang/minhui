			<h3>Project 1: The Game of Hog</h3>
			<p>
				Two players alternate turns trying to 
				be the first to end a turn with at least 100 total points. On each turn, 
				the current player chooses some number of dice to roll, up to 10. That player's
				 score for the turn is the sum of the dice outcomes.
			</p><br/>
			<h3>Project 2:Autocorrected Typing Software</h3>
			<p>
				This project need us to implement the typing speed measurement which is inspired by Type Racer. 
				Additionally, we need to implement typing autocorrect, which is a feature that attempts to correct 
				 the spelling of a word after a user types it.
			</p><br/>
			<h3>Project 3: Ants Vs. SomeBees</h3>
			<p>
				This is an interesting project. It is a a tower defense game which is 
				inspired by PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies.As the ant queen, we populate our colony 
				with the bravest ants you can muster. Our ants must protect their queen from the evil 
				bees that invade our territory.
			</p><br/>
			<h3>Project 4: Scheme Interpreter</h3>
			<p>
				In this project, we implement an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language. Scheme 
				is a simple but great functional language. The interpreter can take either Scheme expressions 
				or scm files and output expected results. I learned that transfers Python to Scheme as well as 
				other programming languages is feasible and they are actually powerful.

			<h3>Project 1: Deques</h3>
			<p>
				In this project, we will build implementations of a “Double Ended Queue” using both 
				linked lists and arrays. This project will also introduce you to the idea that when 
				you are implementing a data structure that adheres to some public API (application 
				programming interface) there will be multiple ways to do so. 
			</p><br/>
			<h3>Project 2: Gitlet</h3>
			<p>
				In this project you’ll be implementing a version-control system that mimics some 
				of the basic features of the popular system Git. Ours is smaller and simpler, 
				however, so we have named it Gitlet.
				In this project I need to implemented the following functionality:
				
				Saving the contents of entire directories of files. In Gitlet, this is called committing, 
				and the saved contents themselves are called commits.
				<br/>
				Restoring a version of one or more files or entire commits. In Gitlet, this is called 
				checking out those files or that commit.</br>
				Viewing the history of our backups. In Gitlet, we view this history in something called the log.</br>
				Maintaining related sequences of commits, called branches.</br>
				Merging changes made in one branch into another.</br>
			</p><br/>
			<h3>Project 3: Bear Maps</h3>
			<p>
				This is an interesting project.  It is a web mapping application inspired by Alan’s time on the Google Maps 
				team and the OpenStreetMap project, from which the tile images and map feature data was downloaded.In this project, 
				we build the “smart” pieces of a web-browser based Google Maps clone. In this project we were implementing and extending 
				a few data structures and algorithms in this class. Namely, we implemented a -d tree, extend our MinHeapPQ, and implement the A* algorithm.

			<h3>Project 1: Game of Life</h3>
			<p>
				This is a programme to introduce the C language. In this project, we will build 
				implementations of translating the digital file to a picture. 
			</p><br/>
			<h3>Project 2: Classify</h3><br/>
			<p>
				Use RISC-V assembly language to implement matrix operations.
			</p><br/>
			<h3>Project 3: CPU</h3><br/>
			<p>
				Using Logism software to design/simulate a fully functioning cpu, 
				which supports RISC-V assembly language. Support pipelining, bubbling, 
				and support many program. But not supporting reduced command.
			</p><br/>
			<h3>Project 4: Numc</h3>
			<p>
				Utilizing multithreading and pragma, loop unrolling, cache blocking, 
				temporal/spatial locality to implement a program for which enhance the performance 
				of naive O(n^3) matrix multiplication. Compare with the most naive implementation of 
				matrix multiplication, we achieve an about 200 times faster running time, and 1500 times 
				faster matrix pow. And around 5 times faster matrix other operations.

			<h3>Project 1: Search</h3>
			<p>
				In this project, our Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. 
				We will build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.
			</p><br/>

			<h3>Project 2: Multi-Agent Search</h3>
			<p>
				In this project, we design agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. Along the way, 
				we implement both minimax and expectimax search and try our hand at evaluation function design.
			</p><br/>

			<h3>Project 3: Logic and Classical Planning</h3>
			<p>
				In this project, we will use/write simple Python functions 
				that generate logical sentences describing Pacman physics, aka pacphysics. 
				Then we will use a SAT solver, pycosat, to solve the logical inference tasks associated with 
				planning (generating action sequences to reach goal locations and eat all the dots), 
				localization (finding oneself in a map, given a local sensor model), mapping (building the map from scratch), and SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping).
			</p><br/>

			<h3>Project 4: Inference in Bayes Nets</h3>
			<p>
				In this project, we implemented inference algorithms for Bayes Nets, specifically variable elimination and value-of-perfect-information computations. 
				These inference algorithms will allow you to reason about the existence of invisible pellets and ghosts.
			</p><br/>

			<h3>Project 5: Machine Learning</h3>
			<p>
				In this project we build a neural network to classify digits, and more! This project will be an introduction to machine learning.
			</p><br/>

			<h3>Project 6: Reinforcement Learning</h3>
			<p>
				In this project, we implement value iteration and Q-learning. We tested our agents first on Gridworld (from class), 
				then apply them to a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pacman.

			<h3>Project 1: sql</h3>
			<p>
				In this project we will be working with the commonly-used Lahman baseball 
				statistics database (our friends at the San Francisco Giants tell us they use it!) 
				The database contains pitching, hitting, and fielding statistics for Major League Baseball 
				from 1871 through 2019. It includes data from the two current leagues (American and National), 
				four other "major" leagues (American Association, Union Association, Players League, and Federal 
				League), and the National Association of 1871-1875.
			</p><br/>

			</p><br/>

			<h3>Project 5: Recovery</h3>
			<p>
				In this project you will implement write-ahead logging and support for savepoints, rollbacks, and ACID compliant restart recovery.
				<br>Implement recovery scheme using logging. Define different types of transaction status to notify program what should the program do next.</br>
				Implemented restart recovery, recover transactions after it crashed.</br>
